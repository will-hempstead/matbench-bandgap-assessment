# matbench-bandgap-assessment
Assessment from 'Data Analytics for Chemists' module taken as part of 'Digital Chemistry' MSc at Imperial College London. 
Our task is to explore the experimental bandgap dataset from matbench (https://matbench.materialsproject.org/Leaderboards%20Per-Task/matbench_v0.1_matbench_expt_gap/) and try out some different approaches to predict bandgap. I made some benchmark models (XGBoost), investigated feature importance using sklearns permutation importance function, made a more sophisticated two-step model which combines a classifier and regressor to better deal with the zero-inflated data, and made an attempt at a transfer learning model pretrained on DFT bandgap dataset (also from matbench). So far the only model which beats vanilla XGBoost is the two-step model.
